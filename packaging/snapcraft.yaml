summary:   Multi-Algorithm Cryptocurrency - 60 ways to mine
description: |
  GlobalToken (GLT) is the worldâ€™s largest proof-of-work cryptocurrency with support for 60 mining algorithms, the most algorithms of any cryptocurrency.
  This optimizes for mining, which increases transaction speed and lowers costs, making GLT ideal for daily use.
  Founded in 2016, GlobalToken uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
  The core team maintains an official mining pool for all algorithms at all times to support the network on 7 continents, increasing access and reducing latency to the network.
  Masternodes are available for 50,000 GLT to contribute to the network.
